# PipeFlow

PipeFlow is a task orchestration manager inspired by Luigi and AirFlow,
 that brings some of the ideas of how micro-services are developed and operated to this area.
 It is developed with Scala, and won't require any kind of central scheduler or server to operate,
 as every application (or set of workflows) will be fully autonomous and provide its own web interface.

Right now this is just a proof of concept on development.

You will find some [documentation here](docs/index.md).
